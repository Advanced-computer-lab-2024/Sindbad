## Motivation
Sindbad is designed to provide a comprehensive platform for managing and booking all travel-related services, including activities, itineraries, products, and moreâ€”all in one place. The motivation behind Sindbad is to create a seamless, efficient experience by offering everything you need for your trip, from start to finish, on a single platform. Whether you're planning, booking, or managing your travels, Sindbad aims to streamline the entire process for both users and service providers.

## Build Status
- Project is in development stage
- The current build status of the project is stable. 
- More automated tests should be added in the future.


## Code Style

**Indentation:** Our code is indented with spaces 2.

**Naming Conventions:** 
- Variables and functions follow camelCase naming convention
- React components follow PascalCase naming convention 
- mongoDB collections use the plural nouns namins convention

**Comments:** Use meaningful comments sparingly to explain complex logic or important details.

**Variable Declaration:** Only use let or const to declare variables.

**Design Pattern:**
The project follows the MVC design pattern that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. The Files in the backend was divided into the M (models) where the schema of the models exist which represent the core of the database , the C (controller) where the functions needed for the routes exists and the V (views) the view in MERN stack is represented by the react frontend server.

## Code Examples
### Starting the server
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
app.use(
    cors({
        origin: "http://localhost:5173",
        methods: "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH",
        credentials: true,
    })
);

// Connect to MongoDB, and prevent connecting to the database during testing
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "test") {
    mongoose
        .connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
        .then(() => {
            console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
        })
        .catch((err) => {
            console.error("Database connection error:", err);
        });
}
// Start the server
let PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "test") {
    PORT = 0; // Finds first available port, to prevent conflicts when running test suites in parallel
}
const server = app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
### Example of a Route Definition
```javascript
app.post(
    "/seller/upload/:id",
    upload.fields([
        { name: "idCardImage", maxCount: 1 },
        { name: "taxationRegistryCardImage", maxCount: 1 },
    ]),
    SellerController.addSellerDocuments
);
```

### Example of a React Component
```jsx
function TotalRevenue({ data }) {
  const currency = useCurrency();
  let chartData = data?.map((item) => ({
    date: new Date(item.createdAt).getTime(),
    revenue: item.revenue,
  }));
  let totalSum = calculateTotalSum(chartData);
  let trend = calculateRevenueTrend(chartData);
  chartData = groupByDay(chartData);

  return (
    <Card className="w-full">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Total Revenue</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <ChartContainer config={chartConfig} className="min-h-[200px]">
          <AreaChart data={chartData}>
            <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />
            <XAxis dataKey="date" scale="time" type="number" />
            <YAxis />
            <Area dataKey="revenue" />
          </AreaChart>
        </ChartContainer>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
