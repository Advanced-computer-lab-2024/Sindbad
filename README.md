## Build Status
- Project is in development stage
- The current build status of the project is stable. 
- More automated tests should be added in the future.


## Code Style

**Indentation:** Our code is indented with spaces 2.

**Naming Conventions:** 
- Variables and functions follow camelCase naming convention
- React components follow PascalCase naming convention 
- mongoDB collections use the plural nouns namins convention

**Comments:** Use meaningful comments sparingly to explain complex logic or important details.

**Variable Declaration:** Only use let or const to declare variables.

**Design Pattern:**
The project follows the MVC design pattern that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. The Files in the backend was divided into the M (models) where the schema of the models exist which represent the core of the database , the C (controller) where the functions needed for the routes exists and the V (views) the view in MERN stack is represented by the react frontend server.

    revenue: item.revenue,
  }));
  let totalSum = calculateTotalSum(chartData);
  let trend = calculateRevenueTrend(chartData);
  chartData = groupByDay(chartData);

  return (
    <Card className="w-full">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Total Revenue</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>

          <AreaChart data={chartData}>
            <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />
            <XAxis dataKey="date" scale="time" type="number" />
            <YAxis />
            <Area dataKey="revenue" />
